# Uncoolc

This repo is just my implementation of a compiler following the Stanford course [Compilers](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/stanford-university-compilers). The implementation is a work in progress.

The code might be very different from the implementations presented in the course as I'm trying to write each bit _ahead_ of the relevant class, which I think maximizes the educational purpose of the project.

## Build 

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Test

Tests are built as part of the normal build. After you build with the instructions above, just run:

```sh
./tests
```
